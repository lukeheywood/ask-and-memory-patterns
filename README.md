# Ask & Memory Patterns
### Grounded answers from living systems

This repository explores design patterns for **Ask systems**:
how users query memory, and how answers stay grounded, traceable, and coherent over time.

It exists to go beyond “RAG hype” into **memory as a system component**.

## 🧭 What is an Ask system?

An Ask system is not just search.

It is a layer that:
- translates questions into retrieval intent,
- selects what memory is allowed to answer,
- and produces responses that can be traced back to sources.

## 🧠 Memory as Structure

This repo focuses on:
- memory indexing strategies,
- boundary rules (what should/shouldn’t be recalled),
- grounding answers in sources,
- and avoiding narrative hallucination.

## 🔍 Key Questions

Patterns here explore:
- What counts as valid memory?
- How do we prevent overreach?
- How do we show where answers came from?
- How do we age or retire memory?
